### Installation
After downloading the repo, you will need to run npm install from within the repo. Then, run the schema.sql file, located in the db folder, in the mySQL workbench to initialize the database. If you would like to begin with a sample set of burgers, you can also run the seeds.sql file in the same way. Then you can simply use the command 'node server' from within the repo to start the server. Navigating to localhost:8080 in your browser of choice will display the site.

### Usage
From the site users can add new burgers, and mark burgers that have been added as devoured.
